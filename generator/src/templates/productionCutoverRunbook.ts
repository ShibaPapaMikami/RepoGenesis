## Purpose
Run the first production deployment for ${brief.project.name} in a controlled way.

## Preconditions
- \`docs/runbooks/production-bootstrap.md\` is complete.
- The current generated docs still match the intended release.
- \`repogenesis doctor --project <project-root>\` passes on the release candidate.
- All adopted env vars from \`.env.example\` are provisioned in the target environment.
- Any required migrations, seed data, or infrastructure changes are prepared and reviewed.

## Cutover steps
1. Freeze the release candidate.
   - Record the commit SHA, build artifact, and deploy operator.
2. Confirm environment readiness.
   - Secrets present
   - External dependencies reachable
   - Monitoring destination enabled
3. Apply schema or infrastructure changes in the approved order.
4. Deploy the application release.
${multiRepoNote}5. Run smoke checks.
   - Public entrypoint responds
   - Auth path responds, if auth exists
   - Primary write path or mutation path succeeds
   - Logging and alerting receive fresh events
6. Verify the first operational workflow end to end.
   - Choose one representative workflow from \`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md\`.
7. Announce cutover completion with known limitations and rollback owner.

## Stop conditions
- Required secrets are missing.
- A migration is only partially applied.
- Primary workflow smoke checks fail.
- Monitoring is blind during deploy.

## Evidence to capture
- Deployed version / commit
- Time of deploy
- Operator
- Smoke test result
- Any partial failures or mitigations
