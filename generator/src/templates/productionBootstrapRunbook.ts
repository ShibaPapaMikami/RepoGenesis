## Purpose
Prepare ${brief.project.name} for its first real deployment before any cutover work starts.

## Inputs to confirm
- \`PROJECT.md\`
- \`docs/TECH_DECISIONS.md\`
- \`docs/EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES.md\`
- \`.env.example\`
- \`SECURITY.md\`
- tool wrapper files (\`AGENTS.md\` / \`CLAUDE.md\` / \`GEMINI.md\`) when present

## Bootstrap checklist
1. Confirm the deployment scope for this project.
   - Expected scope: ${deploymentScope}
   - Record the environment names to support: development / staging / production.
2. Assign owners.
   - Product owner
   - Technical owner
   - Operations owner
   - Security contact
3. Provision required external services.
   - Cross-check adopted dependencies in \`docs/EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES.md\`.
   - Record which service is the system of record for data, auth, storage, queues, notifications, and observability.
4. Create the environment variable inventory.
   - Start from \`.env.example\`.
   - Record where each secret lives and who can rotate it.
5. Define access control.
   - Decide who can deploy, who can change secrets, and who can approve production rollout.
   - If this project handles user data, credentials, or regulated data, map those controls back to \`SECURITY.md\`.
6. Decide monitoring and alerting.
   - Runtime health check
   - Error reporting
   - Audit trail location
   - On-call or primary responder
7. Decide backup and restore expectations.
   - Data backup schedule
   - Restore owner
   - Recovery point / recovery time expectations

## Exit criteria
- All adopted external dependencies have named owners.
- All required env vars have a real secret source.
- Production access and approval roles are defined.
- Monitoring, rollback owner, and incident contact are documented.
