export function generateRollbackRunbook(brief: ProjectBrief): string {
  return `# rollback.md

## Purpose
Restore ${brief.project.name} to the last known good production state when a release is not safe to keep running.

## Rollback triggers
- Primary workflow is unavailable or corrupt after release.
- Authentication, authorization, or billing behavior regresses.
- Error rate or latency exceeds the agreed operational threshold.
- A migration or integration change cannot be completed safely.

## Rollback procedure
1. Declare rollback ownership.
   - Name the incident lead and communication owner.
2. Freeze further deploys and config changes.
3. Identify the last known good release.
   - Commit SHA
   - Artifact or image tag
   - Required matching config version
4. Revert application and infrastructure changes in the approved order.
5. If migrations are involved, decide whether rollback is safe or whether forward-fix is safer.
6. Run the checks in \`docs/runbooks/production-checks.md\`.
7. Announce rollback completion and remaining risk.

## Data integrity notes
- Record whether any writes happened during the failed release window.
- Record whether third-party side effects already occurred.
- If secrets or credentials may have been exposed, rotate them immediately after service is stable.

## Follow-up
- Open a post-incident review.
- Capture the exact rollback trigger.
- Update deployment and cutover docs before the next production release.
